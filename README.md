# Classification

There are different types of machine learning, they include:

- Supervised: When the data points have a known outcome.
  - Regression
  - Classification
- Unsupervised: When the data points have an unknown outcome.
- Semi-Supervised: When we have data with known outcomes and data without outcomes.

Regression is used when we predict a continuous outcome. Typical examples include:

- House prices
- Box office revenues
- Event attendance
- Network load
- Portfolio losses

Classification is used when we predict a categorical outcome. Typical examples include:

- Detecting fraudulent transactions
- Customer churn
- Event attendance
- Network load
- Loan default

The most common models used for classification are:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbours
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Tree
- Neural Networks
- Random Forests
- Boosting
- Ensemble Models
